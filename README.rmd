    - [x] create a species list in long form with the ID
  - [ ] Common name matching (rinat) 
    - resolve error "No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8."
  - [x] *h*-index (specieshindex)
    - [x] put quotation marks around synonyms
    - [x] fix weird NA dataframe (putting synonyms around the synonyms seems to have fixed the problem)
    - [x] divide species list into 2 to fix timeout issue
    - [x] run the 2nd list next week since I've reached the limit of 20,000 requests this week
