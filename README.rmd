    - will have to come back to do this after itis is working again
  - [x] Synonym matching (rotl)
    - [x] create a species list in long form with the ID
  - [ ] Common name matching (rinat) 
    - resolve error "No encoding supplied: defaulting to UTF-8."
  - [x] *h*-index (specieshindex)
    - [x] put quotation marks around synonyms
