    - [x] collected from IUCN
    - [x] try pivot_wider() 
  - [x] IUCN status (5934 spp)

## :abacus: Pre-analysis

  - [x] Combine datasets (8308 spp)
  - [x] More cleaning up 
    - [x] remove species with only genus or species name (8305 spp)
  - [x] Add classification levels (taxize)
    - will have to come back to do this after itis is working again
  - [x] Synonym matching (rotl)
    - [x] create a species list in long form with the ID
  - [x] *h*-index (specieshindex)
    - [x] put quotation marks around synonyms
    - [x] fix weird NA dataframe (putting synonyms around the synonyms seems to have fixed the problem)
    - [x] divide species list into 2 to fix timeout issue
    - [x] run the 2nd list next week since I've reached the limit of 20,000 requests this week
  - [x] Missing data (mice)
  - [x] Google Trends (gtrendsR)

## :art: Making graphs

  - [x] h vs mass 
  - [ ] h vs phylogeny :round_pushpin:
    - something wrong with the new artificial tree, need to find out why
  - [x] h vs location 
  - [x] *h*-index map
  - [x] h vs human use
  - [x] h vs domestication
  - [x] h vs iucn
  - [x] h with vs without conservation keyword
    - [x] check for patterns
  - [x] Google Trends sum
  - For all plots
    - [x] change font
    - [x] change h-index axis scale to true values
    - [ ] add p-values / other stats on the plots

## :rocket: Statistical analysis :gem::round_pushpin:
  - [x] correlation matrix of complete entries 
  - [x] Phylogenetic signals (phytools)
  - MCMCglmm 
    - [x] impute 10 datasets
    - [ ] Pagel's Î» (calculated from MCMCglmm results)
    - [x] trim all trees + pick 50 randomly
    - [ ] write nested loop + TESTING :round_pushpin:
    - [ ] katana
    
## :jigsaw: Other materials :gem::round_pushpin:
  - [ ] data summary table for thesis
  - [ ] supplementary material
